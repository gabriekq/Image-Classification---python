# Image-Classification---python
Image Classification - dogs – cats

This is the second version of the Project called (Image Classification - dogs – cats) at this version the processes to create a read the model was split at two files. 
The files called app-saveModel and createModel-mendonca basically create models from pics located at some directory in the system. Once the model is created. The user can run the file called (load-model) and aim the folder to try the model.
Before you run this app you have to check few things

1 – Check if have pictures of dogs and cats named as (dog.1.jpg) and (cat.1.jpg) or anything similar if you want to create your own model.

2 - If you want to use the pre-exist at the load-model uncomment the model that you want use and comment the model one that you don’t want to use. (model.load() ).

I also want to thanks this guy who me this project possible.
